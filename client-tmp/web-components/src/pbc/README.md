# PBC

This directory contains PBCs that have been added dynamically via the `genx add` command. Each `genx add` will create
a new changeset for you and your team to review and merge. You may choose to tailor the generate PBC assets post
`genx add` for fine grain control, but be aware that doing so makes it more difficult to automate future PBC upgrades.
You may need to re-add a PBC that you have previously edited and re-merge any changes to it yourself.
