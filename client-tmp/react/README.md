# GenesisLCAP React Showcase Client Application

## Overview

This application serves as a showcase for demonstrating the integration and capabilities of foundation-ui components (web components) from GenesisLCAP within a React framework. It provides a practical example of how these components can be effectively utilized in a modern React application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/integration-examples.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd integration-examples/react/showcase
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The app will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run test`

Runs unit tests.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### `npm run prettier`

Runs Prettier to format the code according to the project's code style guidelines.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint for linting the project files based on the defined ESLint rules.

### `npm run lint:fix`

Runs ESLint and automatically fixes problems where possible.
